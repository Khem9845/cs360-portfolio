**Portfolio Artifact: Inventory Mobile Application**

This repository contains my completed Project Three App Code Design ZIP file for CS-360 Mobile Architecture & Programming. The ZIP file includes the full Android Studio project, incorporating both the finalized UI design from Project Two and the fully implemented mobile application from Project Three.

**Application Purpose**

The goal of this application was to develop a functional inventory management mobile app that allows users to:

Register and log in securely

Add, edit, and delete inventory items

Store data persistently using SQLite

Navigate through a clean and user-centered interface

The app was designed to address the need for organized, efficient mobile inventory tracking.

**UI and User-Centered Design**

The application includes:

Login Screen

Registration Screen

Inventory Grid Screen

Add/Edit Item Screens

The UI was designed with simplicity, readability, and logical navigation flow in mind. A consistent layout and minimal clutter ensure ease of use.

**Development Approach**

I developed the application incrementally, beginning with UI layout design and progressing to database implementation and backend logic. I used modular coding, input validation, and frequent emulator testing to ensure stability.

Testing Process

Testing was conducted using the Android Emulator. Each feature was tested individually, including authentication, CRUD operations, and database persistence. This process ensured functionality, reliability, and proper user interaction flow.

**Innovation and Problem Solving**

One challenge involved synchronizing database updates with UI refresh behavior. I resolved this by carefully managing activity lifecycle methods and ensuring the data source refreshed correctly after edits.

**Demonstrated Skills**

This artifact demonstrates my ability to:

Develop a multi-screen Android application

Implement SQLite database integration

Apply user-centered design principles

Debug and test mobile applications

Move from design concept to functional deployment
